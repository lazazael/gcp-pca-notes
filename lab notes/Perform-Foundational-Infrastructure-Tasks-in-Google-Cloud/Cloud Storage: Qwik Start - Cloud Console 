Bucket naming rules:

    Do not include sensitive information in the bucket name, because the bucket namespace is global and publicly visible.

    Bucket names must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, dashes (-), underscores (_), and dots (.). Names containing dots require verification.

    Bucket names must start and end with a number or letter.

    Bucket names must contain 3 to 63 characters. Names containing dots can contain up to 222 characters, but each dot-separated component can be no longer than 63 characters.

    Bucket names cannot be represented as an IP address in dotted-decimal notation (for example, 192.168.5.4).

    Bucket names cannot begin with the "goog" prefix. Bucket names cannot contain "google" or close misspellings of "google".*

    Also, for DNS compliance and future compatibility, you should not use underscores (_) or have a period adjacent to another period or dash. For example, ".." or "-." or ".-" are not valid in DNS names.

    Choose Region for Location type and us-east1 (South Carolina) for Location.

    Choose Standard for default storage class.

    Choose Uniform for Access control and uncheck Enforce public access prevention on this bucket to turn it off.
